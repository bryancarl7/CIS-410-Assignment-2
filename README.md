# CIS-410-Assignment-2 #

I'll be honest, its kind of a shit show, I finished the tutorial, but it's 11 on wednesday night, so I have to cut my losses at some point. 
I figured I'd be honest with you and save you thr trouble of having to sort through what I did and did not have, I accomplished the particle effect and the dot product:

Particle effect: Project said to use one, so I just threw one in, its quite obvious when you load in, nothing special.

Dot Product: Should be working by now, it starts to just play the footsteps on loop when you get close enough to the particle effect

I did not manage to finish the other parts of the project, so I hope that this readme explanation will be enough to get me the 10 points for this section. Hope you are doing well and in good health. If you have any questions email me bcarl@uoregon.edu.

Best,
Bryan Carl
